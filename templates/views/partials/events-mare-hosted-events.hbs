<p class="card-details__paragraph">Throughout the year, MARE hosts events statewide to connect and support social workers, waiting children and prospective adoptive families.   Please subscribe to our events newsletter to be notified of upcoming opportunities as they are scheduled.

<p class="card-details__paragraph"><span class="card-details__paragraph-text--bold">Adoption Matching Events</span> – These casual, interactive mixers provide families the opportunity to learn more about foster care adoption, meet waiting children and network with social workers. Some events are open to families at any stage of considering adoption, while others are limited to families with an approved homestudy who are ready to meet waiting children.  Some events are planned for specific populations of waiting children (such as teens, children with special needs, or siblings) or specific populations of families (LGBT families, families of color, or single parents.)  See Making the Most of an Adoption Party for tips.</p>
<p class="card-details__paragraph"><span class="card-details__paragraph-text--bold">Family Support Events</span> – Through trainings, webinars, panels and peer to peer support, prospective adoptive families at any stage in the process can continue to build their knowledge and network of support.</p>
<p class="card-details__paragraph"><span class="card-details__paragraph-text--bold">Fundraising Events</span> – Be a part of bringing a child or teen home to their adoptive family by participating on one of MARE’s fundraising and community building events.</p></p>
